// other page can be build by ourself later

// we implement sign in page and payment gateway by razorpay

//Pages
//-> home page
//-> movie page
//-> categories page
//->auth page
//->razorpay payment gateway

//plans: how are we building it?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

//First we will build: layouts 

//Layouts :i.e like footer and navbar , it is ame for lal the pages
//Routes
//Pages
//Components

// Folder to get started with: components , layouts , HOC

//HOC - higher order components
//components will accept some props and state and it will returm some jsx element.
//so HOC will return a component instead of jsx element, it will combine everything and return the components.
// it return a components thats why it is calle higher order components.

//we will use HOC to handle LAYOUTS

//IN create-react-app, if we wnat to apply layout first approach then we have to use HOC.

// Layout first approach:
//it is completely different from mobile first approach but it will be acquired from the mobile first approach only .
